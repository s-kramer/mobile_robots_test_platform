mobile_robots_test_platform
==================================

A Matlab platform for mobile robots simulations.

This platform was created as part of a project assignment of evaluating the control laws described in the articles in the /pdf directory. It was however implemented with reuse in mind so it allows to define other control laws and simulate the behaviour of groups of mobile robots.

The implementation is object oriented. The simulations are displayed in a graphical manner in real time.
