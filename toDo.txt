+add the gradient climbing force s variable dependency (what does s mean, how to interpret it, how to implement it?)
+add a Distribution class which will manage the Controller forces in order to achieve dynamically changeable group behaviours

SK 12.05.2013 00:30
DONE check the gradient force law

SK 30.04.2013 10:30,02.05.2013 21:30
DONE change the from and to parameters in forceParams stucture
DONE add the ability to choose the continous or 3-stage regulation
+ verify adding the robots to the robots array @ inversePower->update
+ change the non-uniform structures to classes (gives the ability to use uniform structures, and to declare default parameters)
+ add the ability to change the size of plot handle, in order to dynamically add more robot groups to the plot. It is necessary to change the size of the plot (how to do it? Currently the handle is declared as constant 3x1 after creating World instance). Resizing the handle will allow to keep the currently implemented redraw method - changing the Xdata, Ydata,... fields of the plot.
+ test achieving different behaviours by modifying c and sig parameters
+ correct the constant step movement generated by the forces, add the magnitute of the force dependency (d parameter from the article?)

+ World: change the markers at the plot to arrows pointing robots fi direction
+ World, Robot: remove the position structure, state structure provides the same information
+ Regulator: check the regulator parameters for angle and velocity regulation basing on the robots model identification
